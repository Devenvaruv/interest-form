It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents. EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Creating permanently affordable homeownership and building community wealth is not only possible but already happening with EB PREC! You indicated that you’re interested in becoming a Community or Investor Owner - how exciting!
<br><br>
<b>Community Owners</b> are folks rooted in East Bay community, that become members of the Cooperative in order to help shape the future of our own neighborhoods.
<br><br>
Anyone who is a part of the East Bay community can become a Community Owner:
<ol>
 <li>Read and sign the Community Owner Agreement (click here for Mobile)</li>
 <li>Contribute your Member Dues ($10)</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/east-bay-permanent-real-estate-cooperative-18430217721">Attend</a> an East Bay PREC Orientation (3rd Tuesdays), or <a href="https://ebprec.org/orientation">watch</a> the recording</li>
</ol>
That's it, that’s all! Fill out the <a href="https://ebprec.org/community-owner-agreement">Community Owner Agreement</a> to join us Today!
<br><br>
Folks who join as Community Owners are then able to form groups (we call them Owner Groups) to seek out and acquire properties for permanently affordable cooperative ownership, with the support of our organization. Learn more about Owner Groups by watching <a href="https://youtu.be/uaBNv1_3eCo">this video</a>.
<br><br>
Anyone living in California (20+ other states) can also join EB PREC as an <b>Investor Owner</b> by purchasing one or more shares at $1000 each. Those funds are then leveraged to acquire our properties that are co-owned by their residents! To join our community of over 340 Investors:
<ol>
 <li>Sign the Investor Owner Agreement (email us if you prefer a PDF).
Each share is $1,000 and you can purchase multiple shares.</li>
 <li>Send in your investment
We'll email you an invoice with payment options after you signing the agreement.</li>
</ol>
Pro Tip: We offer payment plans! If you want to buy a share but $1,000 at once is out of reach, just let us know and you can pay it off over time. We also offer a subsidy for East Bay residents who would like to invest and might not have the cash on hand. Go here to apply for a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j_OYncfRrR_tC_QFkFA8RQzBFoZeGIzwNNimluOm3gM/viewform?edit_requested=true">Freedom Share</a>!
<br><br>
Thank you again for your interest in The East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative. We look forward to seeing you at Orientation soon and very soon!

It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents.   EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Building community wealth with community land trusts (or CLTS) and permanent real estate cooperatives, like the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, is not only possible but already happening!  You indicated that you were interested in building an ADU on your property, which is another way to build wealth and create more housing opportunities.
<br><br>
The City of Oakland sees ADUs as an important tool in battling the housing crisis. Check our <a href="https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/adu_december_2020_handbook.pdf">their guidebook on ADUs</a> that covers topics like zoning requirements.
<br><br>
Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services (RNHS) is excited to assist you in exploring an opportunity to build an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) on your property. The <a href="https://keystoequity.org/">Keys to Equity</a> program is intended to support both the creation of new ADUs, as well as the renovation and legalization of existing unpermitted ADUs. The Keys to Equity program was developed in collaboration with Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services (RNHS), Self-Help Federal Credit Union (Self-Help), the WellNest Company, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the City of Oakland, and the San Francisco Foundation (SFF) to help simplify and streamline the process for constructing ADUs.
<br><br>
The program provides one-on-one guidance through the development process and a suite of benefits for eligible homeowners, including ADU architectural designs, analysis of your finances and assistance obtaining a loan, access to a customized financial product, and construction services in addition to trainings related to becoming a landlord.
<br><br>
This program is intended to create more housing in areas that are at-risk of greater displacement and expand access to wealth-building for homeowners, with a focus on Black homeowners and those who have been disproportionately impacted by systemic racial and economic inequities within the housing system. KTE-ADU workshops are taking a recess for now. Please contact us with any questions. <a href="https://www.richmondnhs.org/contact-us/">Sign up</a> to get Keys To Equity news and updates delivered to your inbox.

The <a href="https://youtu.be/N-mLgQYB1yM">Our Back Yard Cooperative</a> (also known as OBY), is an alternate option that pays homeowners a monthly fee up to $500 to lease their land and then covers the costs and management of building the ADU.  OBY even finds tenants and performs property management!  Visit their <a href="https://obyhouse.com/house">website</a> if you'd like to learn more and become part of the solution to Oakland's housing crisis.
<br><br>
Some California Homeowners are also eligible for funding through the <a href="https://www.calhfa.ca.gov/adu/index.htm">California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) ADU Grants program</a>. Homeowners can receive up to $40,000 towards the costs of permitting and constructing a new ADU on their property. Apply today!

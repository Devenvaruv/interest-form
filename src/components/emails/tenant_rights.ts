It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents.   EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Building community wealth with community land trusts (or CLTS) and permanent real estate cooperatives, like the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, is not only possible but already happening!  You indicated that you were interested in receiving trainings/information on tenants’/homeowners’ rights, eviction defense or foreclosure prevention.

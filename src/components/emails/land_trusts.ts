Itâ€™s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents. EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Building community wealth with community land trusts (or CLTS) and permanent real estate cooperatives, like the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, is not only possible but already happening!  You indicated that you were interested in learning more about CLTs.    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wdFFhPFtSAj3o9h4qufhT1Fx594TBjl9/view">Community Land Trusts</a> were designed to create stabilized housing by purchasing land and offering homeownership opportunities to low-income residents that are permanently affordable, using government subsidies to help offset costs. 
<br><br>
The Oakland Community Land Trust, launched in response to the subprime lending crisis, has acquired dozens of homes throughout East and Deep East Oakland, making permanently affordable homeownership possible to Oaklanders making less than 80% AMI (Area Median Income). OakCLT sometimes hosts workshops for interested homebuyers, which is a requirement for anyone interested in purchasing a home.  Bookmark and check back on <a href="https://oakclt.org/buyrent/">this page</a> for upcoming workshops.
<br><br>
Other CLTs active in the Bay Area include the <a href="https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/">Sogorea Te Land Trust</a>, <a href="https://nclt.org/">Northern California Land Trust</a>, and <a href="https://www.bayareaclt.org/">Bay Area Community Land Trust</a>.

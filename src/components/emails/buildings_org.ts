It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents.   EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Building community wealth with permanent real estate cooperatives, like the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, is not only possible but already happening!  You indicated that you were interested in organizing your building to improve conditions or secure your housing.
<br><br>
If you're a renter facing challenges with your unit or landlord and would like support asserting your rights or organizing with your neighbors, there are a few tenants' groups you can plug into:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.oaklandtenantsunion.org/">Oakland Tenants Union</a> (OTU) offers regular virtual counseling hours and meetings every 2nd Monday on Zoom</li>
<li><a href="https://baytanc.com/">Tenant and Neighborhood Councils</a>  (TANC) is a Bay Area member-run housing organization building tenant power for renters</li>
<li><a href="https://urbanhabitat.org/regional-tenant-organizing-network">The Regional Tenant Organizing Network</a> (RTON) is a project of Urban Habitat that is uniting tenants across Northern California, from Sacramento to San Jose, working together to rise up against some of the most prominent corporate landlords in the region.</li>
<li><a href="https://cjjc.org/become-a-member/">Causa Justa:Just Cause</a> (CJJC) is an Oakland-based non-profit who organizes its members in the fight for housing justice and supports tenants in exercising their rights</li>
</ol>
There are also some amazing letters, tools and templates to support you in organizing with your neighbors and/or forming a tenants association under the “Tenant Organizing Resources” section  in our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tiXoXHdBdoFod0O9PeJwtYw9HS1fvUEO/view">Housing Navigation Resource Packet</a>!  It’s free to download and full of many other great resources to secure your housing!

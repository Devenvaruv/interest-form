It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents.   EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Building community wealth with community land trusts (or CLTS) and permanent real estate cooperatives, like the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, is not only possible but already happening!  You indicated that you were interested in learning more about the Better Neighbors program and resources.

Funded by a $28.2 million Transformative Climate Communities (TCC) grant from the California Strategic Growth Council, the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> brings together the City of Oakland, 9 community organizations, residents and business owners to implement five projects across four transformative elements in a five-square-mile area in Deep East Oakland. Those 5 projects were recommended and selected by the Deep East community and include: 
<ul>
  <li>affordable housing (led by Related)</li>
  <li>Planting 2000 fruit and street trees (led by OPRF and Planting Justice)</li>

  <li>making improvements to local public space (led by the TCC Community Stakeholder Committee)</li>

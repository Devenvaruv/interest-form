It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents.   EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Building community wealth with community land trusts (or CLTS) and permanent real estate cooperatives, like the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, is not only possible but already happening!  You indicated that you were interested in finding affordable housing. I'm hopeful that our network of resources can serve you.  As a note, EB PREC is not a housing provider; however we do work with community to purchase properties and create permanent homeownership via a shared ownership model to create stability and build community wealth.   
<br><br>
If you are in immediate need of housing, please call 211 to speak directly with a navigator who can match you with opportunities and resources/benefits you may be eligible for based on information you provide.

You'll also be added to our housing search mailing list and will receive information about other openings as they come to our attention, until you indicate that you'd like to be removed.  I would also suggest you all look up and join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/POCHousingNetwork/">People Of Color Sustainable Housing Network on Facebook</a> to stay informed about affordable housing openings in the Bay Area. 
<br><br>
Hopefully one of these resources will get you the support you need right now, but please feel free to contact us if none of these options are helpful or if you need more assistance sorting through them by calling (510) 470-0060 or emailing <a href="mailto:here2stay@ebprec.org"here2stay@ebprec.org</a> or check out our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tiXoXHdBdoFod0O9PeJwtYw9HS1fvUEO/view">Housing Navigation Resource Packet</a> for support!
<br><br>
We will follow up in a few weeks if we haven't heard from you to see how things are coming along. We hope to see you housed and secure soon!

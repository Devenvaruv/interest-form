<br><br>
It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents.   EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Creating permanently affordable homeownership and building community wealth is not only possible but already happening with EB PREC!  You indicated that you’d like to attend a New Member Orientation to learn more about our model of cooperative real estate.  We host an online orientation to our unique model of cooperative real estate every 3rd Tuesday where you can learn more and get questions answered live.  At the end of each quarter our orientation is online AND in-person at the BNSN Resource Center at 94th and International.  Please visit <a href="ebprec.eventbrite.com">ebprec.eventbrite.com</a> to sign up for our next Orientation.  You can also watch a <a href="https://ebprec.org/orientation">recording</a> of our orientation online or check out <a href="https://youtu.be/LC7D_boDd2Q">this video</a> about EBPREC for a quick intro to our coop.
<br><br>
Thank you again for your interest in The East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative.  We look forward to seeing you at Orientation soon and very soon!

It’s the Displacement Avoidance Program (DAP) Team at the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, part of the <a href="https://bnsnoakland.org/">Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors Initiative</a> (BNSN), following up!
<br><br>
Funded by the State of California's Transformative Climate Communities Program, Better Neighborhoods, Same Neighbors envisions an East Oakland with healthy surroundings, safe and accessible transportation and thriving arts and culture that builds community wealth and ensures housing is a human right for existing East Oakland residents. EB PREC is proud to be a partner on this historic initiative!
<br><br>
Creating permanently affordable homeownership and building community wealth is not only possible but already happening with EB PREC! You indicated that you’re interested in forming a group to purchase a building together with us - how exciting! At EB PREC, we’ve created what we call “Owner Groups” that allow community members to come together and pursue projects with the support of the cooperative. <a href="https://ebprec.org/community-owner">Community Owners</a>, <a href="https://ebprec.org/residence">Resident Owners</a>, and <a href="https://ebprec.org/staff-owner">Staff Owners</a> may form Owner Groups - which are one important way for Owners to shape things in their lives and communities. (Per slide 27 of the EB PREC Bylaws). To become an owner, please <a href="http://ebprec.eventbrite.com">attend</a> or <a href="https://ebprec.org/orientation">watch</a> our New Member Orientation, complete the related Owner Agreement and pay any necessary dues.
<br><br>
Examples of Owner Groups include: people seeking to buy property and form a household together; groups of organizations seeking to buy a shared building; neighbors organizing to protect a building or land; a group of folks doing policy work; people forming a community resiliency team. Such groups must be rooted in EB PREC’s Points of Unity (see slides 5 and 6 of the EB PREC Bylaws).
<br><br>
Collective Purchase
<br><br>
Many Owner Groups form in order to purchase land together and become <a href="https://ebprec.org/residence">Resident Owners</a>. Here is more information about collective purchasing:
<ul>
  <li>If you have a property in mind, you can start by filling out our <a href="https://ebprec.org/intake-form">Intake Form here</a>. This will help us get a sense of the project, and do a preliminary analysis.</li>
  <li>You can also see more about our process here in <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-22872016/documents/8d77955e433b45d1bf233351a62a3576/How%20Collective%20Purchasing%20Works%2010%3A20.pdf">How Collective Purchasing Works<a/></li>
  <li>Occasionally we have openings on existing collectively-held land. Check the blog and the <a href="https://ebprec.org/residence">Resident Owners</a> page for future openings.</li>
</ul>
Thank you again for your interest in The East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative. We look forward to seeing you at Orientation soon and very soon!
